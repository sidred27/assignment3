## Contributors

## Environments 
The Anugu Gallery is working on the Production Site which uses wordpress

## Main Branches
The project has two main branches 
Master Branch: The branch used by production site
Staging Branch: THe branch used by staging site(used by local environment)

## Feature Branches
While developing new feature for the plugin, the plugin does not work directly.So we often used staging site as a testing ground in order to prevent errors occurring on 'live' websites, thus avoiding the issues and/or downtime that might otherwise result. 
 
 For example:
 1. Start with the master branch
 2. Create a new-branch
 3. Update, add, commit, and push changes
 4. Push feature branch to remote

## Developemt Environment Setup
Follow these instruction for the setting up development environment

2.Launch GitHub Desktop and follow the initial welcome flow to sign into your GitHub account. You'll see a "Configure Git" step, where you can set your name and email address. To ensure your commits are correctly attributed to your GitHub account, use the email address associated with your GitHub account.

## Deployment Instructions
A wordpress plugin was created. 
I uploaded that folder to the repository of the plugin in github. 
A Wordpress website was created in local host and put this folder in the plugin of the local host which helped us as we edit any code it use to reflect in the local environment. 
Also, I was connected on the github when ever I make any changes in the code or the folders then push it in the github it keeps a track of the work and if anything goes wrong I can revert the comment and get back the code before errors.
